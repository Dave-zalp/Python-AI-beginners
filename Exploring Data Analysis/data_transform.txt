DATA TRANSFORMATION AND FEATURE ENGINEERING (BEGINNER NOTES)

WHAT IS DATA TRANSFORMATION?
Data transformation is the process of changing raw data into a format that a machine learning model can easily understand and learn from.

Why it is important:

Machine learning models work best with numbers

Models can be biased if some features have much larger values than others

Models cannot understand text or categories directly

SCALING NUMERICAL DATA (MinMaxScaler)

MinMaxScaler is used to scale numerical features so that all values fall between 0 and 1.

Example problem:

Age may range from 20 to 60

Income may range from 30,000 to 120,000

Because Income has much larger values, the model may think it is more important than Age.

MinMaxScaler solves this by applying the formula:

(x - min) / (max - min)

After scaling:

Smallest value becomes 0

Largest value becomes 1

All features are now on the same scale

Code example:
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data[['Age', 'Income']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Age', 'Income']])

Explanation:

fit(): learns the minimum and maximum values

transform(): applies the scaling

fit_transform(): does both at once

CATEGORICAL DATA ENCODING (ONE-HOT ENCODING)

Machine learning models cannot understand text such as:

Male / Female

Yes / No

One-Hot Encoding converts categorical values into binary (0 and 1) columns.

Example before encoding:
Gender Purchased
Male Yes
Female No

After One-Hot Encoding:
Gender_Male Gender_Female Purchased_Yes Purchased_No
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1

Each category becomes its own column:

1 means the category is present

0 means the category is not present

Code example:
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['Gender', 'Purchased'])

WHY ONE-HOT ENCODING IS IMPORTANT

If we convert categories like this:
Male = 1
Female = 2

The model may think Female is greater than Male, which is incorrect.

One-Hot Encoding:

Prevents false ranking

Treats all categories equally

COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES

Scaling categorical data (wrong)

Only scale numerical columns

Forgetting to save the scaler

You need the same scaler when predicting new data

Encoding the target variable incorrectly

Sometimes only features should be encoded, not labels

SIMPLE WAY TO REMEMBER

Scaling = making numbers fair

Encoding = translating words into numbers

WHEN TO USE WHAT

MinMaxScaler: when numeric values have very different ranges

One-Hot Encoding: when dealing with text or categories

Label Encoding: when categories have order (Low, Medium, High)
